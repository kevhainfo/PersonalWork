Hi! This is where my code for competitive programming, web development, data science, and optimization heursitics is. 

WILDFIRE PREDICTION
I used the UNET architecture to predict wildfires in a region of Nigeria. My goal is to create an interface which can do the same for any specified region.

This first image depicts a binary segmentation scheme(no widlfire or yes wildfire)

The Jacard Index(area of overlap between prediction and actual) is 0.58

The second image depicts a tertiary segmentation scheme(small or no wildfire, medium wildfire, large wildfire)
More specifically, wildfire size is quantified using Burnt Area(how much of the area encompassed by one pixel is burned?)

The Jacard Index is 0.9(significantly better)


PONG WITH MACHINE LEARNING
I made an application for my high school computer science club: it creates Pong Bots that use data from playing the game to create a bot that mimics that player's movements.


CUCKOO SEARCH
I researched an optimization metaheuristic to solve the traveling salesman problem and wrote a 4000-word paper on it.
