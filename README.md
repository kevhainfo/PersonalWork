# Personal Work
Hi! Below I've detailed my work on the following projects: Spatial-Temporal Farm Analysis as an Applied Computer Vision Intern, Wildfire Prediction, PONG Bot Design, New Approaches to the Traveling Salesman Optimization Problem. I've also included the C++ code for my USACO (United States Computing Olympiad) Silver submissions that were completed during a timed competition.

Computer Vision Internship:
I used satellite imagery, remote sensing data, and deep learning models to predict future yield for a dozen farms across New York. I used PyTorch for the LSTM models and Pix4D for the drone image processing.

This is the poster that summarizes the work I completed during the summer. It shows the results, confusion matrices for the XGBoost and LSTM models, and important takeaways. I'm still working as a researcher for the team this fall (2025).

WILDFIRE PREDICTION:
I used the UNET architecture to predict wildfires on global wildfire maps.

The Jacard Index(area of overlap between prediction and actual) is 0.58

The second image depicts a tertiary segmentation scheme(small or no wildfire, medium wildfire, large wildfire)
More specifically, wildfire size is quantified using Burnt Area(how much of the area encompassed by one pixel is burned)

The Jacard Index is 0.9(significantly better)

PONG WITH MACHINE LEARNING:
This is a design of an AI pong game I made as an activity for my high school computer science club: it creates Pong Bots that mimic a player's movements using Random Forests.

<be>
This is a screenshot of the actual gameplay. The bot is on the left, and the player is on the right. The bot's movements are learned from the player's previous movements relative to the ball's position.

CUCKOO SEARCH:
I used cuckoo search, a nature-based metaheuristic, to find optimal routes to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

<be>
This is the tour produced on iteration 35 of the cuckoo search algorithm. It shows the optimal tour for this particular TSP input.
