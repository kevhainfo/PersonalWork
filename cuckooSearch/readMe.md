This is my implementation of cuckoo search for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Cuckoo Search is a metaheursitic used to speed up the convergence rate and accuracy.

The actual cuckoo search implementation : cuckooOG.py<br>
Extraction of TSP data: problem.py<br>
Lin-Kernighan Heuristic: tsp_LK.py<br>
Plotting TSP datasets and solutions : plot.py<br>
